Below is a list of my pull requests this summer for Google Summer of Code.
Most of my code went into the
[cf-scripts](https://github.com/regro/cf-scripts) repository, which contains
the code for conda-forge's autotick bot. As part of my work this summer, I
also wrote some code for [libcflib](https://github.com/regro/libcflib) and
[conda-smithy](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-smithy). For an in-depth
description of my major goals and accomplishments over the summer, see my
blog post [here]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-08-06-final %}). In
addition to the work described in that post, as one of the lead
developers on the bot, I was instrumental in keeping the codebase running,
fixing bugs, and reviewing PRs.
